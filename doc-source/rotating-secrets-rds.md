# Rotating Secrets for Supported Amazon RDS Databases<a name="rotating-secrets-rds"></a>

You can configure AWS Secrets Manager to automatically rotate the secret for an Amazon RDS database\. Secrets Manager uses a Lambda function Secrets Manager provides\.

**Supported Amazon RDS Databases**  
For the purposes of the Amazon RDS options in Secrets Manager, a supported database means when you enable rotation, Secrets Manager provides a complete, ready\-to\-run Lambda rotation function designed for that database\. For a complete list of the supported databases, see [Databases with Fully Configured and Ready\-to\-Use Rotation Support](intro.md#full-rotation-support)\. For any other type of database, you can still rotate your secret\. However, you must use the workflow for **Other database**\. For those instructions, see [Rotating AWS Secrets Manager Secrets for Other Databases or Services](rotating-secrets-other.md)\.

When you enable rotation for a secret with **Credentials for RDS database** as the secret type, Secrets Manager automatically creates and configures a Lambda rotation function for you\. Then Secrets Manager equips your secret with the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the function\. Secrets Manager creates the IAM role associated with the function and configures the role with all of the required permissions\. Alternatively, if you use the same rotation strategy with another secret, and you want to use the same rotation with your new secret, you can specify the ARN of the existing function and use it for both secrets\.

If you run your Amazon RDS DB instance in a VPC provided by Amazon VPC and the VPC doesn't have public Internet access, then Secrets Manager also configures the Lambda function to run within that VPC\. Secrets Manager also requires that the Lambda rotation function must be able to access a Secrets Manager service endpoint to call the required API operations\. If one or more of your resources in the VPC must communicate with the Internet, then you can configure the VPC with a NAT gateway to enable the Lambda rotation function to query the public Secrets Manager service endpoint\. If you have no requirement to communicate with the Internet, you can [configure the VPC with a private Secrets Manager service endpoint](rotation-network-rqmts.md) accessible from within the VPC\. 

Otherwise, you typically only need to provide a few details to determine the template used to construct the Lambda function:
+ **Specify the secret with credentials with permissions to rotate the secret**: Sometimes the user can change their password\. Other times, the user has very restricted permissions and can't change their password\. Instead, you must use the credentials for a different administrator or "super" user to change the user credentials\. 

  You must specify which secret the rotation function uses to rotate the credentials on the secured database:
  + **Use this secret**: Choose this option if the credentials in the current secret have permissions in the database to change the password\. Choosing this option causes Secrets Manager to implement a Lambda function with a rotation strategy to change the password for a single user with each rotation\. For more information about this rotation strategy, see [Rotating AWS Secrets Manager Secrets for One User with a Single Password](rotating-secrets-one-user-one-password.md)\.
**Considerations**  
Secrets Manager provides this as a "lower availability" option\. Sign\-in failures can occur between the moment when rotation removes the old password and the moment when the updated password becomes accessible as the new version of the secret\. This window of time may be very short—on the order of a second or less\. If you choose this option, make sure your client applications implement an appropriate ["backoff and retry with jitter" strategy](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/) in the code\. The applications should generate an error only if sign\-in fails several times over a longer period of time\.
  + **Use a secret that I have previously stored in AWS Secrets Manager**: Choose this option if the credentials in the current secret contain more restrictive permissions and can't be used to update the credentials on the secured service\. Or choose this if you require high availability for the secret\. To choose this option, create a separate "master" secret and credentials with permission to create and update credentials on the secured service\. Then choose that master secret from the list\. Choosing this option causes Secrets Manager to implement a Lambda function\. This Lambda function has a rotation strategy that clones the initial user found in the secret\. Then the function alternates between the two users with each rotation, and updates the password for the user becoming active\. For more information about this rotation strategy, see [Rotating AWS Secrets Manager Secrets by Alternating Between Two Existing Users](rotating-secrets-two-users.md)\.
**Considerations**  
Secrets Manager provides this option as the "high availability" option because the old version of the secret continues to operate and handle service requests while preparing and testing the new version\. Secrets Manager doesn't deprecate the old version until after the clients switch to the new version\. No downtime occurs while changing between versions\.  
This option requires the Lambda function to clone the permissions of the original user and apply them to the new user\. The function then alternates between the two users with each rotation\.  
If you need to change the permissions granted to the users, ensure you change permissions for both users\.
+ **Customize the function**: You can customize the Lambda rotation function provided by Secrets Manager to meet your organizational requirements\. For example, you could extend the [**testSecret** phase of the function](rotating-secrets-lambda-function-overview.md#phase-verifysecret) to test the new version with application\-specific checks to ensure the new secret works as expected\.
