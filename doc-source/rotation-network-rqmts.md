# Configuring Your Network to Support Rotating Secrets<a name="rotation-network-rqmts"></a>

To successfully rotate your secrets, the Lambda rotation function must be able to communicate with both the protected database or service, and the AWS Secrets Manager service\. The rotation function sends requests to your database or other service to update a user password with a new value\. The function also calls Secrets Manager API operations to retrieve and update the secrets involved in the rotation process\. If your Amazon RDS instance or other secret\-protected service runs in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) provided by Amazon VPC, you must take the following high\-level steps to enable the required connectivity\.
+ **Configure your Lambda rotation function to enable communications between the function and the database instance\.** If you use one of the [database services](intro.md#full-rotation-support) fully supported by Secrets Manager, then the AWS CloudFormation template creating your function determines the public accessibility of your database instance\.
  + If your protected service runs in a VPC and ***not*** publicly accessible, then the AWS CloudFormation template configures the Lambda rotation function to run in the same VPC\. In this scenario, the rotation function can communicate with the protected service directly within the VPC\.
  + If you run your protected service as a publicly accessible resource, in a VPC or not, then the AWS CloudFormation template configures the Lambda rotation function ***not*** to run in a VPC\. In this scenario, the Lambda rotation function communicates with the protected service through the publicly accessible connection point\. 

  If you configure your rotation function manually and want to add it to a VPC, then on the function **Details** page scroll down to the **Networking** section and choose the appropriate **VPC** from the list\.
+ **Configure your VPC to enable communications between the Lambda rotation function running in a VPC and the Secrets Manager service endpoint\.** By default, the Secrets Manager endpoints run on the public Internet\. If you run your Lambda rotation function and protected database or service in a VPC, then you must perform one of the following steps:
  + You can enable your Lambda function to access the public Secrets Manager endpoint by adding a [NAT gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat.html) to your VPC\. This enables traffic that originates in your VPC to reach the public Secrets Manager endpoint\. *This does expose your VPC to a level of risk* because an IP address for the gateway can be attacked from the public Internet\.
  + You can configure Secrets Manager service endpoints directly within your VPC\. This configures your VPC to intercept any request addressed to the public regional endpoint, and redirect the VPC to the private service endpoint running within your VPC\.
