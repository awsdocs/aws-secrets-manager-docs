# Monitor the Use of Your AWS Secrets Manager Secrets<a name="monitoring"></a>

As a best practice, you should monitor your secrets to ensure that usage of your secrets and any changes to them are logged\. This helps you to ensure that any unexpected usage or change can be investigated and unwanted changes can be rolled back\. AWS Secrets Manager currently supports two AWS services that enable you to monitor your organization and the activity that happens within it\.

**Topics**
+ [AWS CloudTrail](#monitoring_cloudtrail)
+ [Amazon CloudWatch Events](#monitoring_cloudwatch)

## AWS CloudTrail<a name="monitoring_cloudtrail"></a>

AWS Secrets Manager is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that captures AWS Secrets Manager API calls and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. CloudTrail can capture all API calls generated by either the AWS Secrets Manager console or your code\. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the secret access request that was made to AWS Secrets Manager, the source IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and so on\.  AWS Secrets Manager is also integrated with the **Event history** feature in CloudTrail\. If an API for AWS Secrets Manager is supported in **Event history**, you can view the most recent 90 days of events in AWS Secrets Manager in the CloudTrail console in **Event history** even if you have not configured any logs in CloudTrail\. 

To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to configure and enable it, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)\.

### AWS Secrets Manager Information in CloudTrail<a name="service-name-info-in-cloudtrail"></a>

CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account\. When activity occurs in AWS Secrets Manager, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events in **Event history**\. You can view, search, and download the past 90 days of supported activity in your AWS account\. For more information, see [Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.html) and [Services Supported by CloudTrail Event History](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events-supported-services.html)\. 

When CloudTrail logging is enabled in your AWS account, API calls made to AWS Secrets Manager actions are tracked in CloudTrail log files, where they are written with other AWS service records\. CloudTrail determines when to create and write to a new file based on a time period and file size\.

AWS Secrets Manager currently supports logging only the following actions as management events in CloudTrail log files\. There are currently no data events\.
+ `CancelRotateSecret`
+ `CreateSecret`
+ `DeleteSecret`
+ `GetSecretValue`
+ `PutSecretValue`
+ `RestoreSecret`
+ `RotateSecret`
+ `TagResource`
+ `UntagResource`
+ `UpdateSecret`
+ `UpdateSecretVersionStage`

Every log entry contains information about who generated the request\. The user identity information in the log entry helps you determine the following: 
+ Whether the request was made with account root or IAM user credentials
+ Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for an [IAM role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) or a [federated user](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html) whose security credentials are validated by an external identity provider instead of directly by AWS
+ Whether the request was made by another AWS service

For more information, see the [CloudTrail userIdentity Element](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.html)\.

 You can view, search, and download the most recent 90 days of AWS Secrets Manager activity in the CloudTrail console\. For more information, see [Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.html)\. You can also create a trail and store your log files in your Amazon S3 bucket for as long as you want, and define Amazon S3 lifecycle rules to archive or delete log files automatically\. By default, your log files are encrypted with Amazon S3 server\-side encryption \(SSE\)\.

If you want to be notified upon log file delivery, you can configure CloudTrail to publish Amazon SNS notifications whenever new log files are delivered\. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon SNS Notifications for CloudTrail](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/getting_notifications_top_level.html)\.

You also can aggregate AWS Secrets Manager log files from multiple AWS regions and multiple AWS accounts into a single Amazon S3 bucket\. 

For more information, see [Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Regions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-receive-logs-from-multiple-accounts.html) and [Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Accounts](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-receive-logs-from-multiple-accounts.html)\.

### Retrieving Secrets Manager Log File Entries<a name="retrieve-ct-entries"></a>

You can retrieve individual events from CloudTrail using any of the following techniques:

**To retrieve Secrets Manager events from CloudTrail logs**

------
#### [ Using the AWS Console ]

The CloudTrail console enables you to view events that occurred within the past 90 days\.

1. Open the CloudTrail console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/)\.

1. Ensure that the console is pointing at the region in which your events occurred\. The console shows only those events that occurred in the selected region\. Choose the region from the drop\-down list in the upper\-right corner of the console\.

1. In the left\-hand navigation pane, choose **Event history**\.

1. Choose **Filter** criteria and/or a **Time range** to help you find the event that you're looking for\. For example, to see all Secrets Manager events, for **Select attribute** choose **Event source**, and then for **Enter event source** choose **secretsmanager\.amazonaws\.com**\.

1. Choose the expand arrow next to event you want to view to see additional details\. To see all of the information available, choose **View event**\.

------
#### [ Using the AWS CLI ]

1. Open a command window where you can run AWS CLI commands\.

1. Run a command similar to the following example\. The output is shown word\-wrapped here for readablility but the real output is not\.

   ```
   $ aws cloudtrail lookup-events --region us-east-1 --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventSource,AttributeValue=secretsmanager.amazonaws.com
   {
       "Events": [
           {
               "EventId": "EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE",
               "EventName": "CreateSecret",
               "EventTime": 1525106994.0,
               "Username": "Administrator",
               "Resources": [],
               "CloudTrailEvent": "{\"eventVersion\":\"1.05\",\"userIdentity\":{\"type\":\"IAMUser\",\"principalId\":\"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\",
                     \"arn\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Administrator\",\"accountId\":\"123456789012\",\"accessKeyId\":\"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\",
                     \"userName\":\"Administrator\"},\"eventTime\":\"2018-04-30T16:49:54Z\",\"eventSource\":\"secretsmanager.amazonaws.com\",
                     \"eventName\":\"CreateSecret\",\"awsRegion\":\"us-east-1\",\"sourceIPAddress\":\"192.168.100.101\",
                     \"userAgent\":\"<useragent string>\",\"requestParameters\":{\"name\":\"MyTestSecret\",
                     \"clientRequestToken\":\"EXAMPLE2-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE\"},\"responseElements\":null,
                     \"requestID\":\"EXAMPLE3-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE\",\"eventID\":\"EXAMPLE4-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE\",
                     \"eventType\":\"AwsApiCall\",\"recipientAccountId\":\"123456789012\"}"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

### Understanding Secrets Manager Log File Entries<a name="understanding-service-name-entries"></a>

CloudTrail log files can contain one or more log entries\. Each entry lists multiple JSON\-formatted events\. A log entry represents a single request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time of the action, request parameters, and so on\. Log entries are not an ordered stack trace of the public API calls, so they do not appear in any specific order\. 

The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry for a sample `CreateSecret` call:

```
  {
    "eventVersion": "1.05",
    "userIdentity": {
      "type": "Root",
      "principalId": "123456789012",
      "arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root",
      "accountId": "123456789012",
      "accessKeyId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
      "userName": "myusername",
      "sessionContext": {"attributes": {
        "mfaAuthenticated": "false",
        "creationDate": "2018-04-03T17:43:50Z"
      }}
    },
    "eventTime": "2018-04-03T17:50:55Z",
    "eventSource": "secretsmanager.amazonaws.com",
    "eventName": "CreateSecret",
    "awsRegion": "us-west-2",
    "requestParameters": {
      "name": "MyDatabaseSecret",
      "clientRequestToken": "EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE"
    },
    "responseElements": null,
    "requestID": "EXAMPLE2-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE",
    "eventID": "EXAMPLE3-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE",
    "eventType": "AwsApiCall",
    "recipientAccountId": "123456789012"
}
```

The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry for a sample `DeleteSecret` call:

```
{
    "eventVersion": "1.05",
    "userIdentity": {
      "type": "Root",
      "principalId": "123456789012",
      "arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root",
      "accountId": "123456789012",
      "accessKeyId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
      "userName": "myusername",
      "sessionContext": {"attributes": {
        "mfaAuthenticated": "false",
        "creationDate": "2018-04-03T17:43:50Z"
      }}
    },
    "eventTime": "2018-04-03T17:51:02Z",
    "eventSource": "secretsmanager.amazonaws.com",
    "eventName": "DeleteSecret",
    "awsRegion": "us-west-2",
    "requestParameters": {
      "recoveryWindowInDays": 30,
      "secretId": "MyDatabaseSecret"
    },
    "responseElements": {
      "name": "MyDatabaseSecret",
      "deletionDate": "May 3, 2018 5:51:02 PM",
      "aRN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3"
    },
    "requestID": "EXAMPLE2-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE",
    "eventID": "EXAMPLE3-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE",
    "eventType": "AwsApiCall",
    "recipientAccountId": "123456789012"
}
```

## Amazon CloudWatch Events<a name="monitoring_cloudwatch"></a>

AWS Secrets Manager can work with CloudWatch Events to trigger alerts when administrator\-specified actions occur in an organization\. For example, because of the sensitivity of such actions, administrators might want to be warned when a secret is deleted or when a secret is rotated\. Another common need is for an alert if anyone tries to use a secret version while it is in its waiting period to be deleted\. You can configure CloudWatch Events rules that look for these actions and then send the generated events to administrator defined "targets"\. A target could be an Amazon SNS topic that emails or text messages its subscribers\. You could also create a simple AWS Lambda function that is triggered by the event, that logs the details of the action for your later review\.

To learn more about CloudWatch Events, including how to configure and enable it, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/)\.

### Monitoring Secret Versions Scheduled for Deletion<a name="monitoring_cloudwatch_deleted-secrets"></a>

You can use a combination of AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) to create an alarm that notifies you of any attempts to access a version of a secret that is pending deletion\. If you receive a notification from such an alarm, you might want to cancel deletion of the secret to give yourself more time to determine whether you really want to delete it\. Your investigation might result in the secret being restored because it really is still needed\. Alternatively, you might need to update the user with details of the new secret that they really should be using\.

The following procedures explain how to receive a notification whenever an AWS Secrets Manager API request for the `GetSecretValue` operation that results in a specific error message is written to your CloudTrail log files\. Other API operations can be performed on the version of the secret without triggering the alarm\. The intent of this CloudWatch alarm is to detect usage that might indicate that a person or application is still trying to use credentials which should no longer be used\.

Before you begin these procedures, you must have already turned on CloudTrail in the AWS account and region where you intend to monitor AWS Secrets ManagerAPI requests\. For instructions, go to [Creating a Trail for the First Time](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time.html) in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide*\.

+ [Part 2: Create the CloudWatch Alarm](#monitoring_cloudwatch_deleted-secrets_part2)
+ [](#monitoring_cloudwatch_deleted-secrets_part3)

#### Part 1: Configure CloudTrail Log File Delivery to CloudWatch Logs<a name="monitoring_cloudwatch_deleted-secrets_part1"></a>

You must configure delivery of your CloudTrail log files to CloudWatch Logs so that CloudWatch Logs can monitor them for AWS Secrets Manager API requests to retrieve a version of a secret that is pending deletion\.

**To configure CloudTrail log file delivery to CloudWatch Logs**

1. Open the CloudTrail console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/)\.

1. On the top navigation bar, choose the AWS region whose secrets you want to monitor\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Trails**, then choose the name of the trail you want to configure for CloudWatch\.

1. On the **Trails Configuration** page, scroll down to the **CloudWatch Logs** section, and then choose the edit icon \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/images/edit-pencil-icon.png)\)\.

1. For **New or existing log group**, type a name for the log group, such as **CloudTrail/MyCloudWatchLogGroup**\.

1. For **IAM role**, you can use the default role named **CloudTrail\_CloudWatchLogs\_Role**\. That role has a default role policy with the required permissions to deliver CloudTrail events to the log group\.

1. Choose **Continue** to save your configuration\.

1. On the **AWS CloudTrail will deliver CloudTrail events associated with API activity in your account to your CloudWatch Logs log group** page, choose **Allow**\.

#### Part 2: Create the CloudWatch Alarm<a name="monitoring_cloudwatch_deleted-secrets_part2"></a>

To receive a notification when a AWS Secrets Manager `GetSecretValue` API requests attempt to use a version of a secret that is pending deletion, you must create a CloudWatch alarm and configure notification\.

**To create a CloudWatch alarm that monitors usage of a version of a secret that is pending deletion**

1. Sign in to the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. On the top navigation bar, choose the AWS region whose secrets you want to monitor\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Logs**\.

1. In the list of **Log Groups**, select the check box next to the log group that you created in the previous procedure, such as **CloudTrail/MyCloudWatchLogGroup**\. Then choose **Create Metric Filter**\.

1. For **Filter Pattern**, type or paste the following:

   ```
   { $.eventName = "GetSecretValue" && $.errorMessage = "*secret because it was deleted*" }
   ```

   Choose **Assign Metric**\.

1. On the **Create Metric Filter and Assign a Metric** page, do the following:

   1. For **Metric Namespace**, type **CloudTrailLogMetrics**\.

   1. For **Metric Name**, type **AttemptsToAccessDeletedSecrets**\.

   1. Choose **Show advanced metric settings**, and then if necessary for **Metric Value**, type **1**\.

   1. Choose **Create Filter**\.

1. In the filter box, choose **Create Alarm**\.

1. In the **Create Alarm** window, do the following:

   1. For **Name**, type **AttemptsToAccessDeletedSecretsAlarm**\.

   1. Following **Whenever:**, for **is:**, choose **>=** an then type **1**\.

   1. Next to **Send notification to:**, do one of the following:
      + To create and use a new Amazon SNS topic, choose **New list**, and then type a new topic name\. For **Email list:**, type at least one email address\. You can type more than one email address by separating them with commas\.
      + To use an existing Amazon SNS topic, choose the name of the topic to use\. If a list is not available, choose **Select list**\.

   1. Choose **Create Alarm\.**

#### <a name="monitoring_cloudwatch_deleted-secrets_part3"></a>

Your alarm is now in place\. To test it, create a version of a secret and then schedule it for deletion\. Then, try to retrieve the secret value\. You will shortly receive an email at the address configured in the alarm, alerting you to the use of a version that is scheduled for deletion\.
