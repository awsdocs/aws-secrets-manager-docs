# Security in AWS Secrets Manager<a name="security"></a>

Security at AWS is the highest priority\. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture built to meet the requirements of the most security\-sensitive organizations\. 

You and AWS share the responsibility for security\. The [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) describes this as security of the cloud and security in the cloud: 
+ **Security of the cloud** – AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud\. AWS also provides you with services you can use securely\. Third\-party auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the [AWS Compliance Programs\.](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/) To learn about the compliance programs that apply to AWS Secrets Manager, see [AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/)\. 
+ **Security in the cloud** – Your AWS service determines your responsibility\. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your company’s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations\.
